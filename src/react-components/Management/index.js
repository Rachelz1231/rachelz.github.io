          Supervised by Edward Kim, I am designing a user-oriented system that
          assists clinicians in creating rehabilitation exercise curriculums
          tailored to individual patients. The system allows doctors to
          consider patients' goals within their living areas, easily create
          exercises by interacting with Virtual Surroundings, and place virtual
          objects to define tasks without needing coding skills.
