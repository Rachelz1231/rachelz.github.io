        I am designing a user-oriented system that assists clinicians in
        creating rehabilitation exercise curriculums tailored to individual
        patients. The system allows doctors to consider patients' goals within
        their living areas, easily create exercises by interacting with Virtual
        Surroundings, and place virtual objects to define tasks without needing
        coding skills.

        A writing assistant designed to enhance users' writing by offering
        valuable suggestions rather than completely rewriting the content
        through AI. Unlike AI-generated rewrites that often use overly fancy
        terms and can sound inauthentic, Rightee focuses on maintaining the
        writerâ€™s voice.
