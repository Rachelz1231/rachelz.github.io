        Admission rates of colleges and universities in the United States can
        vary significantly due to a variety of reasons. We examined factors that
        could potentially impact these admission rates.

        Explored the relationship between annual earnings of MLS players and
        their performance, constructing a valuable linear regression model for
        the soccer market. This model helps soccer clubs accurately estimate a
        player's value and offers a roadmap for performance improvement to boost
        earnings.

        As data analysis students who rely on computers daily, we understand
        their significance in our lives. However, we often encounter situations
        where our computers slow down or freeze due to high CPU usage.
        Monitoring CPU usage can help prevent system crashes. To address this
        issue, our study aims to identify the specific tasks that cause high CPU
        usage when running on a computer.
